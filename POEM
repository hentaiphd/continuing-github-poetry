it's 2013 and anime still isn't real
and my laptop burning thighs
and a livestream, headphone
tide.

the lense of my iphone camera
scrapes every last scrap of skin
off the earth and
onto instagram
like a corpse.

xbox burn
so i can inhale 3D graphics
and transcend oculus rift,
fly away, a witch on a
machine gun.

no google glass no eyes
no iphone no voice
no bose no ears
no brita no water
no bcp no baby
no tampon no period
no money no food
no bottle no water
no technology no soul.

soul of a teen
salary of a queen
in my dreams.

cables are my crown
url in my hair
idling recursive
curls in curls in curls
makeup
compile my face.

remember when you were 10
and mario's wing cap seemed
like the most
rare and important thing
in the world.

remember that boobs still
sell graphics cards
for nvidia in
the year of our lord
2013.

may all women rest in peace,
their breasts translated
in polygons for
all men to stare.

do you ever wonder
how many people are following
in the footsteps of your
internet shadow?

facebook photo,
a candle,
dry wax on
your face.

dark grain
crop circle eyes
every photo
taken tonight.

we type more than
we kiss
lips
lips
shaped like
a space bar.

our closets are
asylums for abandoned
beanie babies.
hot wheels our
hot rods--
in which aisle
can i find sunset?

I'm in McDonald's
watching my mom eat ice cream
off a knife,
where are you?

'fucking tumblr teens,'
i say as i take yet another selfie
in the dressing rooms at TJMaxx.
